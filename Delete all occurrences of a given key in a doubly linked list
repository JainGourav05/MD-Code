<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>The linked list is one of the most important concepts and data structures to learn while preparing for interviews. Having a good grasp of Linked Lists can be a huge plus point in a coding interview.</p>
<h3>Problem Statement</h3>
<p>We will be given a doubly linked list, and a key X, and our task will be to delete all occurrences of a given key X from the linked list.</p>
<h3>Problem Statement Understanding</h3>
<p>Let’s try to understand the problem statement with the help of examples.</p>
<p>According to the problem statement, we will be given a doubly linked list and a key X. We have to delete all occurrences of a given key X from the linked list.</p>
<p>If the given doubly linked list is: head → 1 ←→ 2 ←→ 5 ←→ 2 ←→ 2 and key X = 2.</p>
<ul>
<li>As we can see that there are 3 occurrences of key X=2 in the given doubly linked list, so we will have to remove all these occurrences of X=3 from the linked list.</li>
<li>Our output linked list after removing all the occurrences of 2 will be: head → 1  ←→ 5.</li>
<li>Removing all the occurrences of a given key X from the linked list means removing all the nodes from the linked list with data equal to X.</li>
</ul>
<p>If the given doubly linked list is: head → 2 ←→ 3 ←→ 3 ←→ 5 ←→ 3 ←→ 2 ←→ 5 ←→ 2 ←→ 2 and key X=3.</p>
<ul>
<li>Our doubly linked list after removal of all the occurrences of X=3 will be: head → 2 ←→ 5  ←→ 2 ←→ 5 ←→ 2 ←→ 2</li>
</ul>
<h5>Some more examples</h5>
<p>Sample Input 1: head → 1 ←→ 3 ←→ 5 ←→ 3 ←→ 4, X = 3
Sample Output 1: head → 1 ←→ 5 ←→ 4.</p>
<p>Sample Input 2: head → 1 ←→ 3 ←→ 5 ←→ 7 ←→ 9 ←→ 1 ←→ 3 ←→ 5 ←→ 7, X = 5
Sample Output 2: head → 1 ←→ 3 ←→ 7 ←→ 9 ←→ 1 ←→ 3  ←→ 7.</p>
<p>Now I think from the above examples, the problem statement is clear. So let's see how we will approach it. Any Ideas?</p>
<ul>
<li>If not, it's okay. We will see in the next section thoroughly how we can approach this problem.</li>
</ul>
<p>Let’s move to the next section.</p>
<h3>Approach</h3>
<p>Our approach will be simple: </p>
<ul>
<li>We will start traversing through the list and if the current node's data is equal to X, we will join the current's previous node to its next node and will delete the current node.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Algorithm</h3>
<ul>
<li>Initialize pointer variable <strong>curr</strong> with head node.</li>
<li>We will start traversing the linked list using pointer <strong>curr</strong>.
<ul>
<li>While traversing the list, if the current node’s data <strong>(curr-&gt;data)</strong> is not equal to X, we will move forward. </li>
<li>While traversing, if the current node’s data <strong>(curr-&gt;data)</strong> is equal to X, then we will delete this node and will join the immediate previous node of the current node to current's next node.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Our linked list after the traversal will be the final resultant linked list free from nodes having data equal to X.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Code Implementation</h3>
<p>[TABS_R id=4886]</p>
<h4>Output</h4>
<p>Original Doubly linked list before deletion: 1 2 5 2 2
Doubly linked list after deletion of all occurrences of 2: 1 5 </p>
<p><strong>Time complexity:</strong> O(N), Since we have traversed through the list once.
