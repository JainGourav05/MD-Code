### Concepts Used
> Linked lists,reverse a linked list

### Difficulty Level
> Medium.

### Problem Statement :
&gt;Given a linked list containing N nodes, if the `(`i+1`)`th node is greater than the ith node than delete the ith node `(0&lt;=i&lt;=Nâˆ’1)`, this repeats till there is no smaller element in the left side of any element.

### Example:
```
The list 11->16->10->8->5->6->2->3->NULL should be changed to 11->10->8->5->2->NULL. 
Note that 16, 6, and 3 have been deleted because there is a smaller value on the left side.
```
