<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>The linked list is one of the most important data structures to learn while preparing for interviews. Having a good grasp of Linked Lists can be a huge plus point in a coding interview.</p>
<p>In this article, we are going to learn how to use the LinkedList add() method in Java.</p>
<p>The add() method adds an element to the list. There are two variations of the LinkedList add() method. Let us have a glance at the approaches of both of them.</p>
<h3>Approach and Algorithm</h3>
<h4>add(Object X) method</h4>
<p>In this method, we pass an object X as a parameter to this function. As a result, this function appends the object element passed to the end of the list.</p>
<p><strong>Syntax:</strong> <strong>boolean add(Object X)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> It returns true only if the action of append is performed.</p>
<h4>Code Implementation</h4>
<p>[TABS_R id=4168]</p>
<h4>Output</h4>
<p>The list is:[Coding, is, Fun, 10, 20]
The new List is:[Coding, is, Fun, 10, 20, Computer]</p>
<p><strong>Time Complexity:</strong> O(1), as the new object is being added to the end of the list, which takes constant time.
<strong>Space Complexity:</strong> O(n), the number of object elements that have to be added.</p>
<h3>Approach and Algorithm</h3>
<h4>add(int index,Collection X) method</h4>
<p>In this method, we pass a Object X  and an index as parameters to this function. As a result, this function appends the element passed to the specified index that is passed as a parameter.</p>
<p><strong>Syntax:</strong> <strong>void add(int index,Object X)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> No value is returned by this method.</p>
<h4>Code Implementation</h4>
<p>[TABS_R id=4169]</p>
<h3>Output</h3>
<p>The list is:[Coding, is, Fun, 10, 20]
The new List is:[Coding, is, Super, Fun, 10, 20]</p>
<p><strong>Time Complexity:</strong> O(n), as we have to traverse the given index to add the element.
<strong>Space Complexity:</strong> O(n), where n is the number of elements to be added.</p>
<p>So, in this article, we have tried to explain how to use LinkedList add() method in Java. Java Collections is an important topic when it comes to coding interviews.
