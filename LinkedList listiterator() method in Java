<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>The linked list is one of the most important data structures to learn while preparing for interviews. Having a good grasp of Linked Lists can be a huge plus point in a coding interview.</p>
<p>In this article, we are going to learn how to use the LinkedList listIterator() method in Java.</p>
<h3>Approach and Algorithm</h3>
<h4>listIterator() method</h4>
<p>This method returns a list-iterator containing all the same elements as that of the given LinkedList, in the same sequence, starting from a specific index that is passed as a parameter to the listIterator() method.</p>
<p><strong>Syntax :</strong> <strong>ListIterator newlist= LinkedList.listIterator(int index)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> The index specifies the position form where the ListIterator will start operating and return values.</p>
<p><strong>Return value:</strong> Returns the list made using the ListIterator, starting from the given index.</p>
<h4>Code Implementation</h4>

<h4>Output</h4>
<p>LinkedList: [Coding, is, Fun, 10, 20]
The list is as follows:
Fun
10
20</p>
<p><strong>Time Complexity:</strong> O(n), where n is the number of elements present starting from the given index, till the end of the list.
