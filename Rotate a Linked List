<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>The linked list is one of the most important data structures to learn while preparing for interviews. Having a good grasp of Linked Lists can be a huge plus point in a coding interview.</p>
<h3>Problem Statement</h3>
<p>In this question, we are given a singly linked list and an integer X. We have to rotate the list counter-clockwise by X nodes.</p>
<p>Note: X is smaller than the count of nodes in the linked list.</p>
<h3>Problem Statement Understanding</h3>
<p>Let’s try to understand the problem statement with help of example.</p>
<p>Suppose the given linked list 1 → 2 → 5 → 10 - 12 → 13, and the value of X is 4. Now, we have to rotate the given list counter-clockwise by X. </p>
<p>Here, rotating counter-clockwise a linked list by X means that the first X nodes of the linked list will be removed from the start and get appended to the end of the list.</p>
<p>In the given list, the first 4 nodes are 1 → 2 → 5 → 10. Now, these 4 elements will get appended to the end of the list. So, the final list will be:
12 → 13 → 1 → 2 → 5 → 10.</p>
<p>In this way, we are rotating the given first X nodes counter-clockwise. </p>

<p><strong>Explanation :</strong> As the value of X is 4, so the first 4 nodes have been removed from the beginning of the linked list and appended at the end of the linked list.</p>
<p>Now, I think from the above example, it is clear what we have to do in this problem. So let’s move to approach.</p>
<p>Before directly jumping to approach in the next section, just try to think how will approach this problem?</p>
<p>It’s okay if your solution is not the best optimized solution, we will try to optimize it together.</p>
<p>This question is not a very complex one. We are going to make use of linked list traversal in this question. Let us have a glance at the approach.</p>
<h3>Approach and Algorithm</h3>
<p>The approach is going to be pretty simple. </p>
<p>Let us first think about what we need to perform the required task of rotating the list counter-clockwise by X nodes.</p>
<ul>
<li>For linked list rotation, we have to change the next of X<sup>th</sup> node to NULL, next of the last node to the head node, and finally, make the head point to the (X+1)<sup>th</sup> node.</li>
<li>So, we need X<sup>th</sup> node, (X+1)<sup>th</sup> node and the last node.</li>
</ul>
<p>To acheive the above objective of rotation: </p>
<ul>
<li>We will traverse through the list and stop at the X<sup>th</sup> node. </li>
<li>We will store the pointer to the X<sup>th</sup> node.</li>
<li>The (X+1)<sup>th</sup> node can be reached using the next of X<sup>th</sup> node. Now, we will keep traversing the list till the last node, and change the pointers as stated below:
1) Change the next of X<sup>th</sup> node to NULL
2) Next of the last node to the head node.
3) And finally, make the head point to the (X+1)<sup>th</sup> node.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Code Implementation</h3>

<h4>Output</h4>
<p>Given linked list
1 2 5 10 12 13
Rotated Linked list
12 13 1 2 5 10 </p>
<p><strong>Time Complexity:</strong> O(n), as list traversal is needed.
